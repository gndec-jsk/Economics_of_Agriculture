# AGRO-PROCESSING IN INDIA

## 1. Meaning and Significance of Agro-processing in India

Agro-processing refers to the set of activities that convert raw agricultural commodities into value-added, marketable, or consumable products. In the Indian context, agro-processing is strategically important because:

- Agriculture still employs about two-thirds of India’s population, while contributing only around 14% to GDP.
- India is a global leader in the production of milk, pulses, tea, spices, fruits, vegetables, and cereals.
- Post-harvest losses remain extremely high—about **35% losses in fruits & vegetables**, equal to wastage worth **₹44,000 crore**, exceeding the MNREGA budget in 2011–12.
- Average food processing levels in India are only **~6%**, compared to **60–70% in developed countries** and **30%+ in Asian peers**.

**Thus, agro-processing is not merely an industrial activity—it is a developmental strategy** for reducing wastage, increasing farm income, employment creation, and ensuring food security.

## 2. Specificities of Agro-processing (Indian Context)

Agro-processing industries have certain unique characteristics, which in India become even more pronounced due to structural issues in agriculture.

### a) Dependence on Agriculture & Seasonality
Raw material availability varies with monsoons, climate, and biological cycles. With **45% of Indian agriculture still monsoon-dependent**, seasonality creates volatility in plant capacity utilization.

### b) High Perishability & Weak Post-Harvest Infrastructure
India suffers extreme losses due to:

- Inadequate cold chain  
- Poor rural roads  
- Traditional supply chains  
- Delays in procurement  

**Example:** West Bengal tomato farmers (2013) dumped tomatoes as farm-gate prices crashed, while consumers paid ₹12–15/kg—showing deep supply chain inefficiencies.

### c) Quality Variability
Variations in farm practices, lack of grading, and differences in moisture content make standardization difficult, affecting export competitiveness.

### d) Location-Specific Nature
Agro-processing plants function best near raw material sources. India promotes **cluster development** (e.g., Mega Food Parks) as a policy response.

### e) Technology Dependence
India is transitioning from traditional to modern technologies such as:

- UHT milk processing  
- Aseptic packaging  
- Dehydration & freeze drying  
- Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP)

### f) Strong Backward & Forward Linkages
PDF analysis shows:

- Food Processing Industries (FPI) use **36% of inputs from agriculture**.  
- **Backward linkage coefficient = 1.2947**, highest among all sectors.

This indicates that **growth of FPI strongly stimulates agricultural growth**.

### g) Regulatory Sensitivity
Compliance with **FSSAI**, **APEDA**, SPS/TBT export standards adds cost and affects operational flexibility.

## 3. Developmental Role of Agro-processing Industries in India

Agro-processing is emerging as an **engine of rural transformation**.

### 1. Reduction in Post-Harvest Losses

India loses:

- **35% fruits & vegetables**
- **15% food grains**

Losses valued at **₹2.5 lakh crore (ASSOCHAM estimate)**.

Processing enhances shelf life, reduces waste, and prevents distress sales.

### 2. Increasing Farmers’ Income & Price Stability

Value addition examples:

- Tomatoes → puree/ketchup  
- Milk → cheese/butter  
- Wheat → flour/bakery products  

Processing stabilizes prices and boosts farm income.

### 3. Employment Generation (Labour-intensive Sector)

PDF data shows:

- FPI is the **largest employer among industries (12.2%)**, higher than textiles (11.5%) and metals (8%).
- High employment for women and rural youth.
- Linked sectors—packaging, logistics, retail—create multiplier impacts.

### 4. Agricultural Diversification

FPI promotes shift towards:

- Horticulture  
- Livestock  
- Fisheries  
- Plantation crops  

This improves resource use, nutritional security, and export potential.

### 5. Export Competitiveness

India exports:

- Spices  
- Marine & meat products  
- Ready-to-eat items  
- Fruits & vegetable preparations  

Processing increases India’s share in global agri-trade.

### 6. Rural Industrialisation & Inclusive Growth

Agro-processing reduces disguised unemployment and creates rural non-farm jobs.

### 7. Enhancing Food & Nutritional Security

Processing supports:

- Year-round food availability  
- Fortified foods  
- Better storage and preservation  

Vital for reducing malnutrition (42% children; 50% women anaemic).

## 4. Selection and Evolution of Processing Options (Indian Perspective)

Factors influencing selection:

### 1. Raw Material Characteristics
- High-moisture → drying/canning
- Surplus milk → dairy processing
- Oilseeds → expellers/solvent extraction

### 2. Market Demand Trends
Urban consumers prefer:

- Ready-to-eat  
- Nutraceuticals  
- Organic foods  
- Packaged snacks  
- Clean-label products  

### 3. Technological Evolution in India
**Traditional → Intermediate → Modern**

- Traditional: milling, pickling  
- Intermediate: cold storages, mechanical dryers  
- Modern: UHT, MAP, IQF freezing, integrated food parks  

### 4. Financial Feasibility
SMEs = **75%** of FPI, but face credit constraints.

Supported by:

- PMFME  
- PMKSY  
- NABARD schemes  

### 5. Policy Influence
Policies shaping the sector:

- Food Processing Policy 2005  
- Mega Food Parks  
- Cold chain schemes  

### 6. Evolution Pattern
- **Pre-1991:** small-scale, low-tech  
- **1991–2000:** liberalisation, entry of corporates  
- **2000–2010:** export boom  
- **2010–present:** cold chain expansion, ecommerce integration, health foods
