# **AGRICULTURAL FINANCE – EXAM NOTES**  

# **1. Agency Relationship in Agricultural Finance**

Agricultural lending involves a **principal–agent relationship**:

| Principal                                        | Agent                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Lender (banks, cooperatives, MFIs, moneylenders) | Borrower (farmers, agribusiness operators) |

### Why agency issues arise?

- **Information asymmetry**: Farmers know more about their ability, risk, intentions than lenders.  
- **High monitoring costs**: Agriculture is dispersed, rural information is costly to gather.  
- **Uncertainty**: Weather, pests, price fluctuations increase risk.

### Indian context

- **High screening/monitoring costs** → banks rely heavily on collateral & documentation.  
- Informal lenders rely on **reputation, personal ties, interlinked contracts**, reducing monitoring costs.

# **2. Adverse Selection**

Adverse selection occurs **before loan sanction**, when lenders cannot identify safe vs. risky borrowers.

### Why severe in agriculture?

- Production uncertainty  
- Lack of formal records  
- Unclear land titles  
- Borrowers hide true risk  

### Insights from PDFs

- **Stiglitz–Hoff**: Raising interest rates → attracts **riskier borrowers** → **credit rationing**.  
- **Indian rural credit**: Collateral and land-title issues exclude marginal farmers → **self-selection bias**.

### Consequence

- Many farmers depend on **informal lenders**, despite high interest rates.

# **3. Moral Hazard and Enforcement Problem**

Occurs **after loan disbursement**.

### Moral hazard in agriculture

Farmers may:  
- Divert loans to consumption  
- Underinvest in inputs  
- Choose riskier crops  

### Enforcement problems

- Weak enforcement → higher default → lenders ration credit instead of raising interest.  
- **Willful default**, political interference, weak contract enforcement → high NPAs.

### Tools to reduce moral hazard

- Joint liability (SHGs/JLGs)  
- Monitoring through extension workers  
- Interlinked contracts (input credit tied to crop purchase)  

# **4. Segmented Rural Credit Markets**

India’s rural credit system is **fragmented**:

### Segments

1. **Formal sector** – Banks, RRBs, cooperatives  
2. **Semi-formal** – MFIs, NBFCs  
3. **Informal** – Moneylenders, traders, landlords, relatives  

### Reasons for segmentation

- High information/enforcement costs  
- Moneylenders use **local information & social ties**  
- Banks operate only where land titles/collateral exist  

### Implication

- Informal credit remains significant despite expansion of formal credit.

# **5. Resolving Information and Incentive Problems**

### **A. Indirect mechanisms**

- Using **interest rate** as a screening tool (limited due to adverse selection).  
- **Reputation-based lending** in repeated interactions.

### **B. Direct mechanisms**

- Screening & monitoring  
- Collateral requirements  
- Interlinked transactions (credit tied with input/output markets)

### **C. Institutional innovations in India**

- Kisan Credit Cards (KCC)  
- SHG–Bank Linkage  
- Joint Liability Groups  
- Digitized land records, Aadhaar-KYC  
- Crop insurance (PMFBY)  
- Warehouse receipt financing  

# **6. Managing Borrowers’ Credit Risks**

### 1. **Diversification**

Across crops, regions, and borrower types.

### 2. **Crop & Weather Insurance**

PMFBY and weather-based insurance lower systemic risk.

### 3. **Credit scoring & digitization**

Remote sensing, satellite data, e-KYC, digital payments.

### 4. **Social collateral**

SHGs/JLGs rely on peer monitoring.

### 5. **Flexible repayment**

Linked to crop cycles; moratoriums after crop failure.

# **7. Agribusiness and Trade Financing**

Agricultural finance now supports the entire **value chain**.

### Types of finance

- Working capital for processing  
- Export finance  
- Post-harvest loans  
- Warehouse receipt finance  
- Supply-chain finance for input firms  

### Supporting institutions

- NABARD  
- EXIM Bank  
- SFAC  
- RRBs/MFIs  

### Why value-chain finance is rising?

- Lower risk via contract farming  
- Assured markets  
- Improved private-sector participation  

# **8. Role of Social Capital in Agricultural Finance**

Social capital = **trust, norms, networks**.

### How it helps

1. Lowers monitoring & enforcement costs  
2. Enables group lending (SHGs/JLGs)  
3. Improves credit access for poor households  
4. Strengthens flow of information  

### Evidence

- Kinship networks reduce information asymmetry.  
- Informal markets depend on relationship-specific capital.  
- Social sanctions in SHGs reduce default.

> **FINAL EXAM POINTERS**
>
> - **Information asymmetry → adverse selection + moral hazard → credit rationing**.  
> - Formal credit constrained by **collateral & monitoring costs**, leading to dependence on **informal lenders**.  
> - Innovations: **KCC, SHGs, JLGs, PMFBY, digital records, warehouse finance**.  
> - Agribusiness financing linked to **value chains & contract farming**.  
> - **Social capital** reduces information/enforcement problems.
