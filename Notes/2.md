# Agricultural Commodity Futures and Options – Notes

# 1. Nature and Principles of Future Markets

Futures markets for agricultural commodities provide a **standardized, exchange-traded mechanism** for buying or selling commodities at a predetermined price for future delivery. They serve two fundamental purposes:

## a) Price Discovery
- Futures prices reflect collective expectations of market participants.
- Aggregates information about supply, demand, weather, global markets, storage, transport, and government policies.

## b) Price Risk Management (Hedging)
- Farmers, traders, processors, and exporters hedge against price volatility.
- Protects income from unpredictable shocks such as monsoon failure, global price shifts, pests, or storage risks.

## Key Features of Futures Markets
1. **Standardization** – quantity, quality, delivery time and place are set by the exchange.  
2. **Margins & Mark-to-Market** – traders deposit initial margin; profits/losses are settled daily.  
3. **Leverage** – a small margin controls a large contract.  
4. **Squaring Off** – 95–98% of contracts are closed before expiry without physical delivery.  
5. **Regulated Exchanges in India** – MCX, NCDEX, NSE Commodity Derivatives Segment.

# 2. Participants in Future Markets

Participants are classified based on motives:

## 1. Hedgers
- Aim to protect themselves from adverse price movements.
- Examples:
  - Farmers hedging against a fall in crop prices.
  - Millers hedging against a rise in raw material cost.
  - Exporters hedging against global price volatility.
- Helps stabilize farm income.

## 2. Speculators
- Trade to earn profit from price movements.
- Provide **liquidity** and absorb risk.
- Improve market efficiency.

## 3. Arbitrageurs
- Exploit price differences between:
  - Spot vs futures markets  
  - Two exchanges  
  - Two delivery centers  
- Bring price alignment across markets.

## 4. Corporate/Institutional Participants
- Agro-processors, exporters, multinational food companies.
- Banks, NBFCs, and commodity funds (indirect participation).

# 3. Trading in the Presence of Risk Aversion and Transaction Costs

Agricultural markets involve high risk due to weather, biological nature of crops, storage limits, transport bottlenecks, and government interventions.

## a) Risk Aversion in Futures Trading
Risk-averse hedgers prefer to **lock in a price** rather than face unpredictable spot markets.

**Example:**  
A wheat farmer hedges in December to secure a March harvest price.

### Benefits
- Stabilizes future income.
- Helps obtain credit (futures prices act as price assurance for banks).

### Cost
- Hedging limits upside gains when spot prices rise.

## b) Transaction Costs
Includes:
1. Brokerage fees  
2. Exchange transaction charges  
3. GST on brokerage  
4. Margin requirement (opportunity cost)  
5. Delivery charges (for physical settlement)  

### Impact
- High transaction costs create **entry barriers** for small farmers.
- High margins during volatility may force early contract closure.

## c) Basis Risk
**Basis = Spot Price – Futures Price**

If basis becomes unstable, hedgers may not get expected protection.

# 4. Future Prices as Expectations

Futures prices reflect the market’s **collective expectations** of future spot prices.

## Why?
They incorporate:
- Supply-demand forecasts  
- Weather outlook  
- Government policy expectations  
- Global market trends  
- Cost of carry (storage, interest, insurance)

## Cost of Carry Model
**Futures Price = Spot Price + Carrying Costs – Convenience Yield**

### Carrying Costs:
- Storage  
- Interest  
- Insurance  

### Convenience Yield:
Benefit of holding inventory (important for processors).

## When Do Futures Prices Reflect Expectations Well?
- Markets are competitive and liquid.
- Policy interventions are predictable.
- Smooth information flow.

## When They Don’t (India-specific)
- Sudden export bans.
- Stock limits under ECA.
- Heavy MSP procurement distorting spot prices.

# Conclusion

- Futures markets provide **risk management** and **price discovery**.  
- Key participants: **hedgers, speculators, arbitrageurs**.  
- Risk aversion and transaction costs heavily influence hedging behaviour.  
- Futures prices act as **expectations of future spot prices**, derived from cost-of-carry and market information.  
- In India, efficiency is improving but affected by policy unpredictability and infrastructural issues.
